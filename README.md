## <co>Blow up levels in the editor!</c>
### Try it with [Editor Sounds](mod:alphalaneous.editorsounds)!!!

Adds a ton of **<cy>bombs</c>** to the Geometry Dash editor.

Just click the **<cy>Bomb</c>** button in the edit tab to open the **<cr>BOOMS</c>** menu and drag the bombs where you wish to cause havoc.

This mod can lag when blowing up objects on high object areas in levels. Too many bombs can cause a crash if your device is weak, tread carefully.

**<cr>I am not responsible for any levels you choose to destroy with this mod, if you blow up your own level and don't have a backup, that's on you.</c>**
